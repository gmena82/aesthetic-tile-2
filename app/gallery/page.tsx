  {
    question: "Do you have project photos specifically from Clermont and across Lake County that I can browse by room type?",
    answer:
      "Yes—many of our gallery photos are from Clermont, Groveland, and Lake County. Contact us if you'd like to see more examples filtered by room type (kitchen, bathroom, fireplace, etc.).",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you recreate a look I saw here?",
    answer:
      "Yes—share the photo; we'll spec tile, grout, trims, and layout to match.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get pricing for a style I like?",
    answer:
      "Send a photo with rough dimensions; we'll give a ballpark before a formal estimate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you photograph completed projects?",
    answer:
      "With permission—photos help future clients visualize results and set expectations.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I visit your showroom or see samples?",
    answer:
      "We work on-site and can bring samples to your home during the estimate. Contact us to schedule.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the typical milestones for projects like those in the gallery (demo → prep → tile → grout), and how long does each stage run?",
    answer:
      "Demo typically takes 1 day, prep and waterproofing 1-2 days, tile setting 1-3 days (depending on size), then grout and final cleanup. Cure times between stages add 24-48 hours. We outline the full timeline in your estimate.",
