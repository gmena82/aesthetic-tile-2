            It's finally here. All that planning and hard work the last two months paid off. We promised you something
            big was coming and here it is. We were allowed to film on location at The Tile Shop in Orlando, and what a
            great experience it was—aisles of inspiration, helpful staff, and room after room of design ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            So here it is: the first of many segments we'll be bringing you from The Tile Shop. We're kicking things
            off with Episode 1 of Myth Breakers, our new series where we take on the biggest myths in remodeling.
            Today's myth: "Tile remodels are too expensive."

          <h2>Myth: "Tile remodels are too expensive"</h2>
          <p>
            We hear this all the time. And we get it—if your only frame of reference is those Pinterest-perfect
            bathrooms with slab walls and full-room mosaics, it looks expensive. But cost isn't just a single number;
            it's the sum of choices. When you understand where each dollar goes—materials, labor, and waste—you gain
            control. You make strategic decisions. And suddenly "too expensive" turns into "totally doable."
